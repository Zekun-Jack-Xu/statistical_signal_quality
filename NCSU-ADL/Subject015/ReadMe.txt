Description:
============

The data is organized in folders for each subject. Each file is in CSV format where the first row indicates the labels for the columns. The files include:

[-] Annotations - The "Annotations.csv" files contains three columns. The first and second columns are the start and end times for each annotation in minutes. The third column is the label in text format.

[-] Physiological Measurements - There are various files for the wearable sensors used for data collection. The first two letters in the file name specify the device: BH - BioHarness, SH - Shimmer Platform, SJ - Science Journal App running on Smartphone. The rest of the name specify the type of data available in the file. In the case of the Shimmer platform the name also specifies the location of the sensor. The header in the file specifies the type of sensing modality and units when available. "TimeSync" refers to the time across all the devices after alignment.

For more detail on the devices used for data collection see article [1]. Please contact Dr. Edgar Lobaton (edgar.lobaton@ncsu.edu) for questions.
